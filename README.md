# AskJosh
Ask Josh is the number one teaching tool of the year. It tells you how to solve a problem with examples rather than telling you than the answer. It searches through all popular search engines to find an answer that is consistent. Then it uses algorithms to detect how to solve this problem with a very similar answer. Josh also has the search the web option it is like a search engine, however, since it is a teaching tool it cannot search anything that is unfiltered. The third feature of Josh is detecting the right thing to do in a situation, it takes all possibilities and detects the right choice to make out of the options you select.
